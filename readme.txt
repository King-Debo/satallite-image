Satellite Image Analysis AI
* This project aims to develop a robust AI system capable of analyzing satellite images to address multiple use cases. The system is versatile enough to identify potential landing sites on celestial bodies like the Moon or Mars and monitor changes in Earth’s environment for applications such as climate analysis and disaster response.

How to use this system
* To use this system, you need to follow these steps:

1. Run this system on your computer or online platform. You will see a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to interact with the system.
2. Select or upload satellite images that you want to analyze from local or online sources using the file chooser widget in the GUI. You can choose multiple images at once.
3. Select the analysis mode that suits your use case using the radio button widget in the GUI. You can choose between landing site identification or earth environment monitoring.
4. Select the analysis features that you want to apply using the checkbox widget in the GUI. You can choose from image processing, object detection, image classification, geospatial data integration, and real-time analysis.
5. Click the start button in the GUI to start the analysis. You will see a progress bar that shows the analysis progress, a text widget that shows the analysis results, and a canvas widget that shows the satellite images and their analysis results.
6. Click the stop button in the GUI to stop the analysis. You can save or export the analysis results as you wish.

What are the features of this system
* This system has several features that can help you with your satellite image analysis tasks. Here is a brief description of each feature:

1. Image Processing: This feature enhances image quality and removes noise from satellite images using various image processing techniques, such as resizing, cropping, filtering, thresholding, etc.
2. Object Detection: This feature identifies relevant features in the images using machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks. It also draws bounding boxes and labels on the images for the detected objects.
3. Image Classification: This feature assigns a class to each image using machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks. It also draws the predicted class on the images for the classified images.
4. Geospatial Data Integration: This feature integrates geospatial data with satellite images for accurate location-based analysis. It also overlays geospatial information on the images for the integrated images.
5. Real-time Analysis: This feature processes images in real-time for monitoring purposes. It also updates the analysis results for each new image that arrives.

What are the requirements of this system
* This system has some requirements that you need to meet before using it. Here are some of them:

1. The system should be scalable to handle a large volume of satellite images.
2. The system should ensure accuracy and reliability in image analysis to support decision-making.
3. The system should create a user-friendly interface for inputting images, viewing results, and configuring analysis parameters.

What is the programming language of this system
* This system is written in Python, which is a popular programming language for its rich ecosystem of image processing and machine learning libraries.

What are the deliverables of this project
* This project has some deliverables that you can expect from this system. Here are some of them:

1. Fully functional AI system capable of analyzing satellite images for the specified purposes.
2. Documentation including user instructions, code comments, and technical details.
3. Testing and validation reports demonstrating the system’s accuracy and performance.
